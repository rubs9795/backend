The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing secure and RESTful API endpoints for user authentication and recipe management. MongoDB with Mongoose is used for data modeling, ensuring flexible and scalable storage for user accounts and recipe details. The server handles image uploads, form data, and authentication flows, and returns structured JSON responses for easy integration with the frontend. The backend is designed to be lightweight, maintainable, and expandable, supporting future enhancements like advanced validations, role-based access, and cloud storage support.
